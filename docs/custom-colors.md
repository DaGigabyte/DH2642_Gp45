## Using Our Own Custom Colors

# To use our own custom colors to match the theme of our design and to be consistent, we can use the following color names:

"pins-primary": "#8D66FC",
"pins-secondary": "#06090D",
"pins-yellow": "#F6FF82",
"pins-red": "#FF5C5C",
"pins-grey-darker": "#757C88",
"pins-grey-dark": "#AEB5C0",
"pins-light": "#F1F3F5",
"pins-menu-hover": "#1D252F",

# It is the same like using Tailwind colors, our colors extend the Tailwind colors.

Example:
Text color: "text-pins-light"
Bg color: "bg-pins-primary"
