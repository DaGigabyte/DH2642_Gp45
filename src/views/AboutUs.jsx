          Welcome! We are four Computer Science students from KTH University
          working on an exciting project for our course, "DH2642 HT23
          Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web (iprogdh)." Our goal is to
          create an advanced website that connects with other online services
          using APIs, a cornerstone in modern web development. We're focusing on
          using Firebase to store our website's information safely and
          efficiently. This project is all about combining our classroom
          learning with real-world web development, making a website that's not
          only functional but also engaging. Join us on this journey as we
          explore the world of web development and bring our classroom theories
          to life!
